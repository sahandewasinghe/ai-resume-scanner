# Problem Statement

Recruiters receive a large number of resumes for a single job role.

with a job description and provides a match score and missing skill feedback.

## Inputs
- Resume text file (.txt)
- Job description text file (.txt)

## Outputs
- Match score (percentage)
- Missing skills list
- Basic recommendations

## Out of Scope
- Hiring decisions
- Personality analysis
- Final candidate selection
